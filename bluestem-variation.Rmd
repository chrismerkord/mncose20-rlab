# Bluestem Variation

## Introduction

In this activity you will apply what you have learned in Finch Example to a new dataset.

Students at Minnesota State University Moorhead collected data at the MSUM Regional Science Center to compare how Big Bluestem (*Andropogon gerardii*) plants allocate energy towards growth and reproduction. 

They measured the height and rame length of hundreds of plants in two locations: a **lowland** site closer to the water table, with more clay content in the soil, and a nearby **upland** site further from the water table and with more sand content in the soil. Plant height is a proxy for growth, and rame length is a proxy for reproduction.

In other words, exactly the same steps you used to compare finches that died vs. survived in the Finch Example.

## The question

The goal of the activity is to answer the following question:

<blockquote class="text-success">Do plant height or rame length of Big Bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerardii</i>) plants vary between lowland and upland sites?</blockquote>

## Your assignment

In this activity, you will create a new R script, read the bluestem data into R, plot histograms of plant height and rame length, estimate the means of those variables, plot them on bar charts, and compare the means using a t-test.

Then create a Word or Google Docs document, copy your figures into it, and write your figure legends and Results paragraph. Submit this document to your instructor.
