# Beak Length Script

Here is the code you used to analyze the beak length in the finches dataset.

You can either copy the code below and paste it into a new R script, e.g. `plant_height.R`, or [download](beak-length.R) it as an R script, copy, and paste from there.

Once you've copied the code, you can work through changing file paths, object names, column names, and axis labels as needed to perform your bluestem analysis.

```{r, code = readLines('beak-length.R'), eval=FALSE}

```
