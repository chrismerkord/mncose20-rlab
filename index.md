# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the website for *Comparing Populations: Introduction to Data Analysis in R*. The site serves as a beginners guide to data analysis in R. In this activity students learn to use R and RStudio to comparing phenotypic variation in biological populations.

This activity was originally developed for the Organismal Biology Lab BIOL 115L at Minnesota State University by Chris Merkord, Alison Wallace, and others.

This version was prepared for the MnCOSE 2020 conference by Chris Merkord and Katie Olson.

In this lab you will learn how to view, summarize, and graph data.

Parts 1 to 3 of this lab will teach you how to use R and RStudio. Part 4 contains the instructions for the assignment you will turn in for your grade.

- In Part 1 of this lab, you will learn what R and RStudio are, how the RStudio environment is organized, and how RStudio organizes your work into Projects. To finish, you will create your first RStudio Project, which you will continue to work in for the rest of the lab. 
- In Part 2 of this lab, you will learn how to use the Console Window to run commands as you perform basic arithmetic operations. You will learn the basics of using functions, and finally learn
about creating objects using the assignment operator. 
- In Part 3 of this lab, you will be introduced to R scripts. You will use the Finches dataset to learn
how to read a tabular dataset into R, inspect it, and perform basic statistical summaries on it. You will estimate means, standard deviations, standard errors of the mean, and confidence intervals around the mean. You will also learn how to plot histograms and barplots. 
- In Part 4, you will apply what you have learned to the bluestem variation data you collected at the Regional Science Center. You will create a new R script, read the bluestem data into R, plot histograms of plant height and rame length, estimate the means of those variables, plot them on barplots.
